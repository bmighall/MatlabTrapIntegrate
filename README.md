# MatlabTrapIntegrate
This is MATLAB code that uses the trapezoidal rule for integration using four user-defined parameters (in order): the set of y points (essentially the equation using linspace points as the x variable), the integration lower X boundary, the integration upper X boundary, and the number of "steps".
This includes two pieces of code: the first is the essential part, a function named trap_integrate, 
that takes the four parameters when called and returns an approximate integrated value using the trapezoidal rule for integration. The second piece of code, named trapintegratedemo, is a demonstration of a few instances of the trap_integrate function.
